            <p>Mostly business technology experience in Arizona, along with travel across the country, I demonstrate
                professionalism and seek positivity in all I do.
                Arizona has been home for most my life, I currently live in Phoenix. Like most I don't enjoy the hot
                summers but I have learned how to tolerate it. I enjoy staying active and spend time with friends and
                family whenever I have free time.
